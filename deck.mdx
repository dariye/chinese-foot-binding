I really only have more questions than answers in this presentation.

# Chinese foot binding

---

## What is it?

Quite literal in the definition when you think about it.

```notes
- - it's a contortion of the feet
- once revered in ancient China as a symbol of status and identity
- an estimated 4.5 billion Chinese women have been subjected to this in the last 1,000 years
```

It is the drastic contortion of the feet to make it look physically smaller.

---

## A little history

- general consensus is that it began the Sung dynasty (960-1279 AD)
- several legends and folk lore about its orgins date back to the Shang dynasty (1700-1027 BC)
- Sung dynasty prince Li Yu who had a fetish for tiny feet and made his concubine dance a variation of the ballet called the 'toe dance' with her feet bound. Her name was Yao Niang. She is said to have been so graceful that she 'skimmed on top of golden lilies'.
- It became rampant practice by the end of the 12th Century
- It spread from a practice in the dynasty court to all social classes during the reign of the Ming Emperor.
---

## history (continued)

- The practice was in decline by the 17th Century when the Ming dynasty was supplanted with the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD) by the Manchu.
- The Emperor Kangxi tried in 1664 to impose a ban on foot binding but was overturned about 4 years later by the Ministry of Rites
- The first anti-foot binding was founded in 1895 in Shanghai on the basis of limited opportunity available to the women that undergo foot binding.
- The Emperor Kangxi tried in 1664 to impose a ban on foot binding but was overturned about 4 years later by the Ministry of Rites
- The first anti-foot binding was founded in 1895 in Shanghai on the basis of limited opportunity available to the women that undergo foot binding.

---

## history (continued)

- It was finally outlawed in 1911 when the Manchu dynasty was toppled by Sun Yat Sen (which followed the formation of the New Republic of China)
- In 1915 the Chinese government declared the practice illegal
- The practice still continued behind closed doors and was even brought to Hawaii by the Punti Chinese (this stopped when a ban was imposed in 1989).

```notes
- one of these is that a fox assumed the guise of the Shang Empress and tried to conceal it's paws. another is that the Shang Empress was club-footed and asked the Emperor to make foot binding mandatory for all girls in the court so that so that her own feet would be the model of beauty in the court.
- The Mongols who supplanted the Sung dynasty with the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) were huge supporters of this practice and preserved it.
- The practice was in decline by the 17th Century when the Ming dynasty was supplanted with the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD) by the Manchu.
- The Manchus abhorred all Han traditions, including foot binding, so they imposed death penalties on those who breached.
- The Emperor Kangxi tried in 1664 to impose a ban on foot binding but was overturned about 4 years later by the Ministry of Rites
- The first anti-foot binding was founded in 1895 in Shanghai on the basis of limited opportunity available to the women that undergo foot binding.
- It was finally outlawed in 1911 when the Manchu dynasty was toppled by Sun Yat Sen (which followed the formation of the New Republic of China)
- In 1915 the Chinese government declared the practice illegal
- The practice still continued behind closed doors and was even brought to Hawaii by the Punti Chinese (this stopped when a ban was imposed in 1989).

## The art of foot binding

1. A foot should not be longer than three inches.
2. The cleft between the heel and the sol should be 2-3 inches deep.
3. The foot should appear as an extension of the leg rather than a stand for the body.


```notes
- mostly women, but men dancers and prostitutes were also subjected to this practice to be more appealing in their art.
- the process begins at the age of 3-11 years old.
- done during late fall or winter when the foot was numb to reduce the pain.
- the initial phase takes about two years but lasts well after ten years to keep the feet bound.

# So what?

Why my interest in this?

```notes
- So what you may be asking
- Why is a kid from mushere interested in an ancient practice from a world away
- FYI, this entire talk was just to tell you more about me for those of you whom I haven't met. It's my shameless plug.

My grandmother, her mother, and women before them pierced their ears and mouth big enough to that a stick up to 15 millimeters (still need to confirm this!) for adornment.

---

## Symbolism

---

The use of symbols to represent ideas or qualities.

---

What is beauty?

---

What is attractiveness?

---

Who gets to define concepts like these?

---

How much power do we give these people (often men) by letting them define these things for us?

---

How have the things I've come to accept been shaped by the social system I was brought up in?

---

## Other examples

- Maori tattoos
- Corsets
